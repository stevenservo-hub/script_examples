# sysadmin_bash_scripts
this is a start to a suite of quick network and system administration tools 

pingnetwork.sh
This is a simple bash script that uses ifconfig to retreive active network info and pings ip's in a /24 format. This script will also run a NMAP scan and show any active port on all active IP's. Add to $PATH and run this script from anywhere

adduser.sh 
This is a quick tool to add user, password, give sudo access and make comments. I will be adding features to make this a more complete and usable tool in the near future. If you plan on using this tool in a business enviroment, you should probably sub SUDO for the groups you commonly assign to users.
